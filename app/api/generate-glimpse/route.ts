CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GROK:
- Grok EXCELS at photorealistic images and following detailed prompts
- Grok responds VERY WELL to atmospheric details (lighting, mood, weather, time of day)
- Grok loves cinematic/photographic language: "bokeh", "wide-angle", "golden hour", "soft morning light"
- Optimal prompt length: 600-700 characters with clear focus
- Grok's chat model will revise your prompt for clarity before image generation

Create an xAI Grok image prompt for this dating scenario:

SCENARIO: ${scenario}
ALICE (THE USER - MUST LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME IN EVERY GLIMPSE): ${userDescription}
MATCH: ${matchDescription}
${userInterests && userInterests.length > 0 ? `INTERESTS: ${userInterests.join(", ")}` : ""}

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS**:
0. MOST IMPORTANT: Include ALL of Alice's specific physical features (hair style/color, eye shape, facial features, height, build, outfit details) EXACTLY as described. This ensures she looks the same across all glimpses.
1. The image MUST show them doing the EXACT activity: ${scenario}
2. Include specific props/equipment that prove it's this activity
3. Front-load the most important details (subject and location first)
4. Emphasize atmospheric details (lighting, mood, weather)
5. Use photographic/cinematic terminology
6. Aim for 600-700 characters total

STRUCTURE (in this order):

**SUBJECT & LOCATION** (most important - say this first):
"Photorealistic candid photograph: [exact venue/location for ${scenario}]. 35-year-old Asian woman with shoulder-length dark hair and warm smile, alongside [match description]."

**ACTION & PROPS** (prove it's this activity):
Be specific about what they're doing and what's visible:
- Bowling â†’ "both holding colorful bowling balls, standing at polished lane with pins visible, wearing bowling shoes"
- Coffee â†’ "sitting at small wooden table, steaming coffee cups in hands, espresso machine visible in background"
- Tubing â†’ "sitting in bright inner tubes on river water, wearing life vests, paddles in hands, water splashing"
- Hiking â†’ "walking mountain trail, wearing backpacks, hiking boots visible, trail markers in background"

**ATMOSPHERE & LIGHTING** (Grok's strength - be detailed):
- Time of day: "soft morning light" / "golden hour sunset" / "bright midday sun"
- Weather/mood: "warm autumn day" / "crisp winter air" / "gentle breeze" / "misty morning"
- Emotional energy: "joyful laughter" / "peaceful contentment" / "playful energy"

**PHOTOGRAPHIC STYLE** (cinematic language):
"Wide-angle shot, shallow depth of field, natural bokeh, slight motion blur from movement, unposed candid moment, real skin texture, documentary photography style"

**QUALITY** (end strong):
"Photorealistic, natural film grain, authentic happy moment"

EXAMPLES (600-700 chars each):

Bowling: "Photorealistic candid photograph: bustling bowling alley interior. Alice, 35-year-old East Asian woman with straight shoulder-length dark brown hair (reaches mid-shoulder blade) with subtle face-framing layers, almond-shaped dark brown eyes with double eyelids, defined cheekbones with soft oval face shape, warm genuine smile showing white teeth, light-medium warm-toned skin (MAC NC25-30 range), 5'5" (165cm) tall, 125-130 lbs, athletic-slender build with toned arms and legs, wearing fitted dark blue jeans and cream long-sleeve top with small 15mm gold hoop earrings, alongside friendly man in his early 30s. Both holding colorful bowling balls, standing at polished wooden lane with pins visible down the lane, wearing bowling shoes. Bright overhead bowling alley lighting with colorful neon accents, late evening atmosphere. Genuine laughter mid-game, making eye contact, other bowlers and glowing scoreboards visible in background. Wide-angle shot, shallow depth of field, natural bokeh, slight motion blur, real skin texture, unposed joyful moment, documentary photography style. Photorealistic, natural film grain."

Coffee: "Photorealistic candid photograph: cozy artisan coffee shop interior with large windows. Alice, 35-year-old East Asian woman with straight shoulder-length dark brown hair with subtle layers, almond-shaped dark brown eyes, defined cheekbones, warm genuine smile, medium skin tone, athletic-slender build wearing fitted dark jeans and white long-sleeve top with delicate gold necklace, natural makeup, alongside friendly man in his early 30s, sitting across from each other at small wooden table. Both holding steaming ceramic coffee cups, espresso machine and menu board visible in background. Soft morning light streaming through windows, warm golden tones, peaceful Saturday morning atmosphere. Genuine laughter mid-conversation, making eye contact, other customers reading books visible behind them. Wide-angle shot, shallow depth of field, natural bokeh on background, real skin texture, unposed intimate moment, documentary photography style. Photorealistic, natural film grain."

River tubing: "Photorealistic candid photograph: calm river surrounded by trees. Alice, 35-year-old East Asian woman with straight shoulder-length dark brown hair, almond-shaped dark brown eyes, defined cheekbones, warm smile, medium skin tone, athletic-slender build wearing fitted jeans and cream top under orange life vest, alongside friendly man in his early 30s, sitting in bright colored inner tubes floating on clear river water. Both wearing orange life vests, holding wooden paddles, water splashing and creating ripples around tubes. Golden hour sunlight reflecting off water surface, warm summer afternoon, gentle breeze. Trees along riverbank visible, genuine laughter and joy, making eye contact, water droplets suspended in air catching sunlight. Wide-angle shot, shallow depth of field, slight motion blur from water movement, real skin texture, candid adventure moment, documentary photography style. Photorealistic, natural film grain."
